## Concept

*Summarise what your system does, its target market and uses cases here*

Here at Qi we found a solution that will revolutionize the way conference centres work. We created Infinitables: motorized tables which autonomously organize themselves into desired layouts. Our goal is to help you save time, human resources and money. With the help of our system you will be able to create your own layouts at the touch of a button.

### Functionality

*What features does your system have? Why should a viewer/investor be interested?*

Qi offers more than a solution for making your daily operations more efficient. We designed Infinitables to look just like regular tables with the aim of making your companyâ€™s switch to our system seamless. Infinitables will add more functionality to your space while the minimalistic and sleek design will transform and modernize it even further.

We implemented fully autonomous multi-agent path finding algorithm with conflict based search and space time A* which allows Infinitables to move simultaneously and effortlessly, thus saving you time and manual labour.

We created a web application which is fully functional and more importantly easy to use. User friendly interface allows you to add new designs and remove or reuse the old ones, execute the layouts and terminate the operation.

## Potential for Future Development 

*What features could you add to your system? How could you change it to reach new people/adapt to new*

As Qi grows we expect to expand beyond the Infinitables. The software we created has potential to be extended and used for wider applications where autonomous movement may be useful: ranging from complimentary chairs for Infinitables or better storage units to self-moving hospital bed.
