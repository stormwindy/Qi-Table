## Concept

Here at Qi we found a solution that will revolutionize the way conference centres work. We created Infinitables: motorized tables which autonomously organize themselves into desired layouts. Our goal is to help you save time, human resources and money. With the help of our system you will be able to create your own layouts at the touch of a button.

### Functionality

Qi offers more than a solution for making your daily operations more efficient. We designed Infinitables to look just like regular tables with the aim of making your company’s switch to our system seamless. Infinitables will add more functionality to your space while the minimalistic and sleek design will transform and modernize it even further.

We implemented fully autonomous multi-agent path finding algorithm with conflict based search and space time A* which allows Infinitables to move simultaneously and effortlessly, thus saving you time and manual labour.

Our easy to use web application allows the user to design new room layouts, remove or reuse old ones, execute them and terminate the operation, all through a visual, user friendly interface.


## Market Research


### Target Customer Segment :

Our product is useful in places that require frequent rearrangement of table layouts, thus suited for events such as business meetings, seminars, conferences, workshops, wedding receptions, dinner parties, etc and the use case could be extended to classrooms and office spaces. Our customer segment would essentially then be business and community centres, event venues, banquet halls, hotels and schools in the UK. 

### Scope in Industry : 

According to the report on the UK’s event industry by eventbrite, the UK has over 10,000 venues with 1.3 billion business events being held each year. The conference and meetings segment is worth £19.9 billion in terms of direct spend to the UK economy.

Professionals are anticipating growth in the industry but for budgets to remain the same, which implies that there is a potential market for technology that could reduce costs and drive up revenues.

### Competitors :

We do not face much direct competition because there are currently no companies in the UK manufacturing automated table systems for our target segments. Nissan launched its Intelligent Parking Chairs, which parks the chairs in its original position with the sound of a clap. Our product differs in two major aspects. They mostly targeted workspaces such as offices and the chairs would tuck themselves back into set positions. Our target segment is wider and the user can change the layouts by selecting from an existing menu or designing one on their own! 
Our competitors are companies who go out on contract bases to do the set up. The venues may also allocate the task to their own team of people. In either case, manual labour would be engaged. 


### Value to Customer :
To understand why the customer would want our product, let's assume a scenario where a team of 5 people spends 3 hrs to set up an average sized venue (which according to the report has a capacity of 258). Given the minimum wage per hour in the UK is £8, the cost would equate to at least £120 for one event set up. 
Our product would replace these recurring expenses with a one time purchase.  Once the system is in place, there would be no incremental purchases required apart from maintenance costs, in case there is any damage. 
The usual prices as found online for tables depending on material and size ranges from £50 - £200. We would customise our tables according to the customer’s wish, so the price would vary accordingly. The number of tables required also vary according to the capacity of the venue, but economy of scale should reduce the cost per entity. 
Our team has discussed the health and safety concerns and implemented safeguards. We have emergency system shutdowns in place to avoid possible collisions invoked by the vision system or manually through the app. 


The big size and growth in the events industry, along with low competition to our product, makes the target market attractive to us. The man power and money saved along with the simple set up, flexibility in the layout designs and easy to use app interface makes our product cost-effective and attractive to our customer. Considering the above factors in our market research, infinitables have good potential for success. 



## Potential for Future Development

One of the largest planned improvements for the next generation of Infinitables is the inclusion of the multi-wireless charging feature. This would allow multiple tables to charge from the same wireless charging point. The charging times for each individual table would be predicted via learnt usage, pre-booked calendar appointments and the quantity of charge remaining. This means the tables decide themselves when and how to charge!

As Qi grows we expect to expand beyond the Infinitables product line. The software we created has the potential to be extended and used within wider applications where autonomous movement may be useful: ranging from complimentary chairs for Infinitables and smart, portable storage units to self-moving hospital beds.
