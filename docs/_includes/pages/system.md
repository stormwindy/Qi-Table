## Concept

Here at Qi we found a solution that will revolutionize the way conference centres work. We created Infinitables: motorized tables which autonomously organize themselves into desired layouts. Our goal is to help you save time, human resources and money. With the help of our system you will be able to create your own layouts at the touch of a button.

### Functionality

Qi offers more than a solution for making your daily operations more efficient. We designed Infinitables to look just like regular tables with the aim of making your companyâ€™s switch to our system seamless. Infinitables will add more functionality to your space while the minimalistic and sleek design will transform and modernize it even further.

We implemented fully autonomous multi-agent path finding algorithm with conflict based search and space time A* which allows Infinitables to move simultaneously and effortlessly, thus saving you time and manual labour.

Our easy to use web application allows the user to design new room layouts, remove or reuse old ones, execute them and terminate the operation, all through a visual, user friendly interface.

## Potential for Future Development

One of the largest planned improvements for the next generation of Infinitables is the inclusion of the multi-wireless charging feature. This would allow multiple tables to charge from the same wireless charging point. The charging times for each individual table would be predicted via learnt usage, pre-booked calendar appointments and the quantity of charge remaining. This means the tables decide themselves when and how to charge!

As Qi grows we expect to expand beyond the Infinitables product line. The software we created has the potential to be extended and used within wider applications where autonomous movement may be useful: ranging from complimentary chairs for Infinitables and smart, portable storage units to self-moving hospital beds.
