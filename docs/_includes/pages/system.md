<h3 align="center">What does our system do?</h3>


Here at Qi we found a solution that will revolutionize the way conference centres work. We created Infinitables: motorized tables which autonomously organize themselves into desired layouts. Our goal is to help you save time, human resources and money. With the help of our system you will be able to create your own layouts at the touch of a button.

Qi offers more than a solution for making your daily operations more efficient. We designed Infinitables to look just like a well polished, easy on the eye table with the aim of making your company’s switch to our system easier. Infinitables will add more functionality to your space while the **minimalistic and sleek personalized design** will transform and modernize it even further.

We implemented **fully autonomous multi-agent path finding algorithm** with conflict-based search and space time A* which allows Infinitables to move simultaneously and effortlessly, thus saving you time and manual labour.

Our **easy to use web application** allows the user to design new room layouts, remove or reuse old ones, execute them and terminate the operation, all through a visual, user friendly interface.


## Market Research

Our product is essential in places that require frequent rearrangement of table layouts, thus suited for events such as business meetings, seminars, conferences, workshops, wedding receptions, dinner parties and more. This use case could easily be extended to classrooms and theatre. Our customer segment would essentially then be business and community centres, event venues, banquet halls, hotels and schools in the UK.

### Scope in Industry

According to the report on the UK’s event industry by eventbrite, the UK has over 10,000 venues with 1.3 billion business events being held each year. The conference and meetings segment is worth £19.9 billion in terms of direct spend to the UK economy.

Professionals are anticipating growth in the industry but for budgets to remain the same, implying that there is a potential market for technology that could reduce costs and drive up revenues.

### Competitors

We do not face much direct competition because there are currently no companies in the UK manufacturing automated table systems for our target segments. Nissan launched its Intelligent Parking Chairs, which parks the chairs in its original position with the sound of a clap. Our niche differs in two major aspects: 
- They mostly targeted workspaces such as offices and the chairs would tuck themselves back into set positions. 
- Our target segment is wider, and the user can change the layouts by selecting from an existing menu or designing one on their own.  

Our competitors are companies who go out on contract bases to do the set up and rearrange the layout. The venues may also allocate the task to their own team of people. In either case, manual labour, risk assessment and wages will be required.


### Value to Customer
To understand why the customer would want our product, let's assume a scenario illustrated bellow:

<img align="center" src="static/imgs/event_cost.png" width="600"/>

Our product would replace these recurring expenses with a one-time purchase.  Once the system is in place, there would be no incremental purchases required apart from very occasional maintenance costs, in the case there is any serious damage inflicted on our product.
The usual prices as found online for tables, depending on material and size, ranges from £50 - £200. We would customise our tables according to the customer’s wish, so the price would vary accordingly. The number of tables required also vary according to the capacity of the venue, but economy of scale should reduce the cost per entity.  

Our team has discussed the health and safety concerns and implemented safeguards. We have emergency system shutdown procedures in place to avoid possible collisions invoked by the vision system or manually through the app.  


The large size and growth in the events industry, along with low competition in our niche, paints the target market very attractively to us. The manpower and money saved along with the simple set up; flexibility in the layout designs; easy to use, fire-and-forget nature of our app interface makes Infinitables both cost-effective and appealing to our customer. Considering the above factors in our market research, Infinitables have huge potential for success.



## Potential for Future Development

One of the largest planned improvements for the next generation of Infinitables is the inclusion of the multi-wireless charging feature. This would allow multiple tables to charge from the same wireless charging point. The charging times for each individual table would be predicted via learnt usage, pre-booked calendar appointments and the quantity of charge remaining. This means the tables decide themselves when and how to charge!

As Qi grows, we expect to expand beyond the Infinitables product line. The software we created has the potential to be extended and used within wider applications where autonomous movement may be useful: ranging from complimentary chairs for Infinitables and smart, portable storage units to self-moving hospital beds.
