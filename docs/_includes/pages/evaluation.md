## Evaluation Tests

### Speed and Accuracy of the Vision Module

It is vital that the vision module can run quickly because it can be called several hundred times in a complete usage cycle. 



It is even more vital that the vision module is as accurate as possible to avoid any chance of collision. We tested vision's accuracy by placing 8 tables in a 4-by-2 formations in different positions and orientations within the operation area. 

Tables were placed equidistant from each other and facing the same direction. We then recorded the position and orientation information returned by vision. In an ideal system, distances between the tables and orientations of the tables should be equal.

The standard error for each of the tests is presented in the table below. On average the standard error is about 0.2° for table orientations and about 0.08cm for distances.


| Test number | Standard error<br>for **orientation** (°) | Standard error<br>for **distance** (cm) |
|:-----------:|:------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| 1 | 0.144 | 0.080 |
| 2 | 0.260 | 0.061 |
| 3 | 0.168 | 0.096 |
| 4 | 0.140 | 0.088 |
| 5 | 0.141 | 0.061 |
| 6 | 0.313 | 0.067 |
| 7 | 0.223 | 0.055 |
| 8 | 0.190 | 0.124 |
| 9 | 0.322 | 0.148 |
| 10 | 0.216 | 0.015 |
| 11 | 0.342 | 0.101 |
